        <h4>Overview</h4>
        <span>
          On January 28, 1742, a ramshackle vessel of patched-together wood and
          cloth washed up on the coast of Brazil. Inside were thirty emaciated
          men, barely alive, and they had an extraordinary tale to tell. They
          were survivors of His Majesty’s Ship the Wager, a British vessel that
          had left England in 1740 on a secret mission during an imperial war
          with Spain. While the Wager had been chasing a Spanish treasure-filled
          galleon known as “the prize of all the oceans,” it had wrecked on a
          desolate island off the coast of Patagonia. The men, after being
          marooned for months and facing starvation, built the flimsy craft and
          sailed for more than a hundred days, traversing nearly 3,000 miles of
          storm-wracked seas. They were greeted as heroes. But then ... six
          months later, another, even more decrepit craft landed on the coast of
          Chile. This boat contained just three castaways, and they told a very
          different story. The thirty sailors who landed in Brazil were not
          heroes – they were mutineers. The first group responded with
          countercharges of their own, of a tyrannical and murderous senior
          officer and his henchmen. It became clear that while stranded on the
          island the crew had fallen into anarchy, with warring factions
          fighting for dominion over the barren wilderness. As accusations of
          treachery and murder flew, the Admiralty convened a court martial to
          determine who was telling the truth. The stakes were
          life-and-death—for whomever the court found guilty could hang. The
          Wager is a grand tale of human behavior at the extremes told by one of
          our greatest nonfiction writers. Grann’s recreation of the hidden
          world on a British warship rivals the work of Patrick O’Brian, his
          portrayal of the castaways’ desperate straits stands up to the
          classics of survival writing such as The Endurance, and his account of
          the court martial has the savvy of a Scott Turow thriller. As always
          with Grann’s work, the incredible twists of the narrative hold the
          reader spellbound.
